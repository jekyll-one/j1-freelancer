  This page is created by the layout HOME.

  If this text is displayed (instead of the home page expected),
  something  went  wrong with the layout definitions. Check  the
  output of the Jekyll engine building this site.

  Check  the  contents   of folder _layouts. Verify  if the base
  layout  "home" exists  and the  referring  chain (inheritance)
  is correct.
